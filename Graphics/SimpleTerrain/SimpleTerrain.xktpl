Name: Simple Terrain Sample
Scope: Session
Description: Creates a sample project which describes how to initialize and utilize dynamic vertex and index buffers to store a generated terrain model.
FullDescription: |
   This sample shows how to create and utilize dynamic vertex and index buffers, in a terrain example.
   It uses a simple algorithm to create a normalized height map called "Fault formation" which is then used to create a terrain.
   Each time a terrain is re/created, data in both vertex and index buffers change accordingly.
