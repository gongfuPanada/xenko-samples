Name: Particles UI Sample
Scope: Session
Description: Particles UI shows how to render particles on top of the UI elements.
FullDescription: This sample uses an orthographic camera on top on the regular scene to render the particles. The second camera only renders entities assigned to Group01, to which we assign all UI particles. Coordinates can easily be controlled from the user script.
